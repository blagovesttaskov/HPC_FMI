# What ?

*	We teach how to write computer programs for performance critical problems, that are effective and efficient. Languages that are used most often in the course are C/C++, OpenCL and CUDA.

*	As prerequisite, you need to have knowledge in C++. Some knowledge in Computer Architectures, Operating Systems, Advanced C++ and GPU programing is nice to have (but not mandatory).

*	The talks are grouped in three main topics - optimizing single threaded programs (1), efficient concurrent and parallel programs (2) and programming GPUs (3).

* "HPC programming" can be interpreted as two differnt things - programming for super-computer-like scenarios (1) or "making things go fast" (2). HPC FMI is all about the later.
